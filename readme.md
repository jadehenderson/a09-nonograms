## Intro

In this project, I created my first GUI using the JavaFx UI library as well as implemented the model view controller design pattern that I learned in class. 

The rules are simple! 

Given a puzzle board and a list of row/column clues, shade or eliminate the cells to complete the puzzle picture based on the given clues. 

For example if one of the row clues was 2 1 1 then in that row there are two consecutively shaded cells followed by *at least* one eliminated/blank cell and then another shaded cell followed by at least one eliminated/blank cell and finally one last shaded cell.
